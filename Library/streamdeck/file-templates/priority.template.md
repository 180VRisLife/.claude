# [Feature Name] Priority Plan

## Project Type
- [ ] New Project (MVP focus - ruthless prioritization, heavy stubbing)
- [ ] Feature Addition (Minimal change focus - complete core feature)

*Auto-detected as: [reasoning]. User confirmed: [yes/no]*

## Tier 1: Build Now
**Complete implementations required for MVP/feature to function**

### [Feature Name]
- **What**: [Brief description]
- **Why Tier 1**: [Why absolutely essential - what breaks without it?]
- **Scope**: [What specifically to build]
- **Files**: /path/to/file, /path/to/other/file

### [Another Feature]
- **What**: [Brief description]
- **Why Tier 1**: [Essential reasoning]
- **Scope**: [What to build]
- **Files**: /path/to/file

## Tier 2: Stub/Placeholder
**Minimal implementations - just enough to make Tier 1 work**

### [Feature Name]
- **What**: [Brief description of complete feature]
- **Why Tier 2**: [Not critical for MVP/core feature]
- **Stub Strategy**: [Specific minimal approach]
  - Examples: "Return hardcoded mock array", "Placeholder UI with 'Coming Soon'", "Basic impl without validation"
- **Files**: /path/to/file (stub)

### [Another Feature]
- **What**: [Brief description]
- **Why Tier 2**: [Reasoning]
- **Stub Strategy**: [How to minimize]
- **Files**: /path/to/file

## Tier 3: Future
**Out of scope - do not build**

### [Feature Name]
- **What**: [Brief description]
- **Why Tier 3**: [Why not needed now - edge case/optimization/polish]
- **When**: [Future consideration - "After MVP validation", "v2.0", etc.]

### [Another Feature]
- **What**: [Brief description]
- **Why Tier 3**: [Postponement reasoning]
- **When**: [When to build]

## Rationale
[2-3 sentences on overall strategy]

New projects: What MVP achieves, why stubs are acceptable for v0.1.
Feature additions: Core needs vs incremental additions.

## Summary
- **Tier 1**: X features (complete)
- **Tier 2**: Y features (stub)
- **Tier 3**: Z features (future)

## Next Steps
1. Review and approve
2. Run `/4-parallelization` (if ≥5 Tier 1) or `/5-execution` (if <5 Tier 1)
