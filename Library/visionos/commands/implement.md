Read the guide from `.claude/guides/implementation.md` and output it in this exact format:

```
<system-reminder>The user has mentioned implementing or building a feature/component.

<implementation-best-practices>
[FULL CONTENT OF IMPLEMENTATION.MD]
</implementation-best-practices>

</system-reminder>
```

This matches the output from the workflow orchestrator hook when triggered by the keyword "implement".
