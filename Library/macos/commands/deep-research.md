Read the guide from `.claude/guides/deep-research.md` and output it in this exact format:

```
<system-reminder>The user has requested deep research or systematic investigation.

<deep-research-workflow>
[FULL CONTENT OF DEEP-RESEARCH.MD]
</deep-research-workflow>

</system-reminder>
```

This matches the output from the workflow orchestrator hook when triggered by the keyword "deep research".
