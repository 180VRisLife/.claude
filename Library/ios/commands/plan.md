Read the guide from `.claude/guides/planning.md` and output it in this exact format:

```
<system-reminder>The user has mentioned creating or making a plan for development. Here's some advice for making plans:

<planning-workflow>
[FULL CONTENT OF PLANNING.MD]
</planning-workflow>

</system-reminder>
```

This matches the output from the workflow orchestrator hook when triggered by the keyword "plan".
