Read the guide from `.claude/guides/brainstorming.md` and output it in this exact format:

```
<system-reminder>The user has mentioned brainstorming or collaborative discovery.

<brainstorming-workflow>
[FULL CONTENT OF BRAINSTORMING.MD]
</brainstorming-workflow>

</system-reminder>
```

This matches the output from the guide injector hook when triggered by the keyword "brainstorm".
