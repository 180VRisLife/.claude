Save the last response as a markdown file on my Desktop. Name the file based on the topic. Put any commands in codeblocks.

Also copy each command from the response to the clipboard using pbcopy, in REVERSE order (last command first, first command last) — with a short sleep between each — so that clipboard history captures them all and the first command ends up as the most recent clipboard entry, ready to Cmd+V.

As the very last step, open the saved markdown file using the `open` command.
