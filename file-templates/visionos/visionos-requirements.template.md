# [Feature Name] Requirements

## Overview
[1-2 sentence description of what this feature does, its primary goal, and the problem it solves.]

## User Flow
[Describe the step-by-step user experience in spatial computing context. What the user sees, does, and expects at each stage.]
1. [User action/trigger - eye tracking, gesture, voice command]
2. [System response/spatial UI change]
3. [Subsequent user action]
4. [Expected outcome]

## Functional Requirements
[List the specific capabilities the system must provide to support the user flow.]
- The system MUST [requirement 1].
- The system SHOULD [requirement 2].

### User Interface
- **Key Windows/Volumes/Spaces**: [Describe the main spatial elements of the feature, e.g., "A volumetric window for 3D model viewing", "An immersive space for data visualization", "A floating panel with controls"]
- **User Interactions**: [How the user interacts with these elements, e.g., "Users can pinch to scale objects", "Eye tracking highlights selectable items", "Hand gestures manipulate 3D content"]

### System Processing
- **Core Operations**: [Describe the main functions the system performs, e.g., "Processes spatial anchor data for persistence", "Manages RealityKit entity hierarchies", "Synchronizes CloudKit data across devices"]
- **Business Logic**: [High-level description of the rules and calculations the system applies, e.g., "Validates spatial boundaries for object placement", "Calculates occlusion for realistic rendering"]
